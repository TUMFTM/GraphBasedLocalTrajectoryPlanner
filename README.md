# Graph-Based Local Trajectory Planner

![Title Picture Local Planner](docs/source/figures/Title.png)

The graph-based local trajectory planner is Python-based and comes with open interfaces as well as debug, visualization
and development tools. The local planner is designed in a way to return an action set (e.g. keep straight, pass left,
pass right), where each action is the globally cost optimal solution for that task. If any of the action primitives is
not feasible, it is not returned in the set. That way, one can either select available actions based on a priority list
(e.g. try to pass if possible) or use an own dedicated behaviour planner.

The planner was used on a real race vehicle during the Roborace Season Alpha and achieved speeds above 200kph.
A video of the performance at the Monteblanco track can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vqQBuTQhQw).

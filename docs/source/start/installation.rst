=============================
This is a brief tutorial how to prepare your workspace to execute the source code of the local planner.

All the code was tested with **Python 3.7**, newer versions should also work. The code was tested for compatibility with
**Linux (Ubuntu)** and **Windows** operating systems.

Use the provided 'requirements.txt' in the root directory of the repository, in order to install all required modules.\

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt


.. note:: If you want to use the planner as is, without adding code in the source-code, you can install the graph-ltpl package, as
    stated below:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip3 install graph-ltpl
